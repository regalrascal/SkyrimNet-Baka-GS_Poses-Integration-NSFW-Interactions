; ============================================================================================
; Acheron STARTS this quest when OUR consequence is SELECTED for a defeat — see the YAMLs in
; SKSE/Acheron/Consequences/*/DownedSkyrimNet.yaml (Teleport:false). Being a real, registered Acheron
; consequence (chosen by Acheron's own priority/weight) is what makes us a proper plugin that COEXISTS
; with YameteKudasai and any other Acheron mod — instead of globally suppressing consequences.
;
; We do the light part here (mark the victim held + fire the first cue) and hand the ongoing hold /
; recovery / repeat cues to the persistent bridge (SkyrimNet_AcheronIntegration), which polls for held
; actors. Then we STOP so Acheron can select us again on the next defeat.
