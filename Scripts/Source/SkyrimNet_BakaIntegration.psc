; Confirmed in live testing: a completely unrelated mod (SkyrimNet_PairedAnimations) can have the
; player's OWN follower "ExecuteTarget" (a scripted kill-move) the player mid-struggle, because that
; mod's eligibility check never considers allegiance at all — any actor is "eligible" against any
; target. We can't fix another mod's code from here, but AddPackageOverride's priority-100 hold already
; blocks every OTHER package/AI-driven behavior from being assigned to an actor while it's active — so
; forcing that same hold onto nearby teammates for the duration of OUR OWN scenes should keep them from
; being hijacked into a kill-scene package by anything else, regardless of what that other mod's
; eligibility logic does or doesn't check.
; akAggressor: the OTHER member of THIS pair (the attacker/creature) — excluded from the sweep below
; (it's handled separately by _SetupPair), never touched otherwise.
; Every OTHER nearby actor (any NPC or creature, ally or hostile, human or beast) is held off combat
; for the duration -- a "cloak of calm" so the pair is effectively ignored by anyone not actually
; involved, without literally turning them invisible. The player is the sole exception: never held,
; always free to interject or be interjected upon. Any hit that DOES land despite this (the player,
; or anything that slips past) still aborts the struggle/scene as normal -- this only stops OTHER
; actors from choosing to start something, it doesn't make the pair invulnerable.
