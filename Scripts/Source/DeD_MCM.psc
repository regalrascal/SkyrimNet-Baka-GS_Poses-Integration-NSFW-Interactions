Scriptname DeD_MCM extends SKI_ConfigBase

; ============================================================================
; DeD_MCM (renamed from SNBaka_MCM at REV-107) — REV-76 REPLACEMENT MCM quest
; ("Delectatio et Dominium").
;
; Lineage: the direct successor of SkyrimNet_BakaIntegration_MCM (the v7 MCM).
; The old quest was neutered at REV-76 (script detached, record kept; its
; cached save-instance was pathological beyond version dispatch — see
; PROJECT_STATE §75/§76). This quest is a FRESH formID (QUST 04000D99): an
; existing save spins up a fresh instance and registers fresh.
;
; CANARY RULE (user ruling, REV-76 — standing for every MCM-touching build):
;   - versioned marker key  SNBaka.MCMDeD.vN  (written once, first registration)
;   - load-time self-check sentinel: ONE greppable "[SNBaka] MCM canary" line
;     at first registration AND at every OnGameReload delivery (which doubles
;     as the SKI_PlayerLoadGameAlias delivery probe — the exact event the old
;     quest never received).
;   - every MCM-touching revision's dogfood includes the EXISTING-SAVE RENDER
;     GATE (old save: all pages render, all sections present).
;
; CLEAN BASELINE (user ruling): version restarts at 1; post-replacement
; updates flow through GetVersion -> OnVersionUpdate on this baseline. The
; old quest's v5/v6/v7 migration markers are NOT re-run here (the saves that
; crossed those revs carry the markers already; they are probes, not data).
;
; Settings: zero migration (REV-76 Task-1 audit) — all player state lives in
; StorageUtil (SNBaka.*, SNBaka.ST.*, SNAcheron.*, player-keyed) or as
; properties on the surviving MAIN quest (04000D62). Known pre-existing skew
; (fEscapeGraceDuration dual-write, old script L793) carried unchanged.
; ============================================================================

; ============================================================================
; REV-106 SEVERANCE (user ruling of record 2026-10-1X, "Boundary S4a" - the SHAPE
; OF RECORD): the MCM quest is the FRAMEWORK's config surface - every module hangs
; its pages on it presence-gated; Baka's settings become module pages like any
; other; the eventual PHYSICAL host is a DeD Framework esp (S4b, esp session -
; this session is script-only, no esp bytes, scriptname/EDID unchanged; the rename
; rides S4b). Task 1.1: the MCM stops using the compiled `Main` property (the esp
; VMAD auto-fill link is what kept the MCM hostage to the motherboard quest) and
; resolves the motherboard AT RUNTIME via GetFormFromFile(0xD62, Baka esp) + cast
; - the same resolution pattern as SkyrimNet_BakaIntegration.GetMain (that script,
; L1207) and SkyrimNet_BakaInteg_SpankPartner (L13). Absent motherboard = None =
; the Baka pages don't build (§74 precedent); the MCM itself lives on. Setting
; storage is UNCHANGED (§73/§75 discipline: no new migration; the resolver hands
; back the exact same quest instance the compiled link used to).
; NOTE (physical reachability, recorded §112): today the MCM quest record and the
; motherboard quest record are co-homed in SkyrimNet_BakaIntegration.esp, so the
; absent-motherboard state is not physically reachable until S4b moves the MCM
; quest record to the framework esp. This machinery is the logical re-home; the
; S4b gate activates it.
; ============================================================================

; ============================================================================
; REV-107 S4b (the PHYSICAL re-home): the MCM quest record MOVED from
; SkyrimNet_BakaIntegration.esp (QUST 04000D99) to the NEW DeD_Framework.esp
; (fresh formID 02000800, masters Skyrim+Update ONLY). Scriptname + EDID renamed
; SNBaka_MCM -> DeD_MCM; the esp VMAD re-binds the renamed script with ZERO
; compiled properties (the S4a resolver is the only motherboard link now; the
; old VMAD's stale `main` property binding is not carried over).
; IDENTITY BOUNDARY (byte-verified this rev): ModName "Delectatio et Dominium",
; all StorageUtil keys (SNBaka.*, SNBaka.ST.*, SNAcheron.*), all "[SNBaka] *"
; log markers, and every GetFormFromFile literal are UNCHANGED — the rename
; touches the script FILE only, exactly like the LoadAlias-era lesson.
; Existing-save expectation: the old 04000D99 cosave instance is orphaned on
; first load after the move (dead cached MCM config instance, KNOWN-BENIGN per
; the REV-76 replacement history; settings live in StorageUtil per §75) —
; one-session cosmetic cost; the new quest instance registers fresh.
; ============================================================================

; ============================================================================
; REV-109 MCM RESTRUCTURE (user ruling 2026-10-1X, era roadmap item 7 + the
; REV-88 planner ticket of record - the productization restructure):
;   - framework-level configurables gather under a NEW "Settings" page (first
;     page): master enable (Enable Mod, moved from General), the global action
;     cooldown (moved from General), the stuck-state reset (moved from
;     General's Maintenance section), the debug log (moved from Scenes & FX),
;     plus the title header + tagline (first-page rider, REV-76 convention).
;   - the five Baka pages fold under a "Baka Interactions" section: SkyUI
;     SKI_ConfigBase Pages[] is a FLAT left-pane list with NO sub-page
;     nesting, so the section is realized as prefixed sibling pages
;     ("Baka - General" / "Baka - Timing" / "Baka - Resist" / "Baka - Spank"
;     / "Baka - Scenes & FX"), grouped contiguously - the §81 precedent
;     (separate expandable pages, not one long page); choice FLAGGED for the
;     user gate (Task 2.1).
;   - module pages UNCHANGED in position/content (Lap Sitting / Cum Effects /
;     Fill Her Up / Acheron / SlaveTats / GS Poses).
;   - NO NEW OPTIONS (no-stubbing rule): what does not exist today (clean
;     uninstall, stop-all beyond the panic reset, framework-native settings)
;     is the REV-109 gap list (era doc; polish pool), not built here.
;   - RIDERS (user ruling 2026-10-1X): the full-surface ASCII sweep (receipt:
;     0 non-ASCII in every runtime string literal, swept comment-stripped
;     this rev) + the display-length audit (labels >40 chars / values >30
;     chars = findings; fixes per class (a) shorten / (b) label-vs-info split;
;     every reworded string -> §7 register, bulk entry).
; ============================================================================

; ============================================================================
; REV-109c MCM RESTRUCTURE PASS 3 (user ruling 2026-10-1X): the "Baka
; Interactions" page is ONE page whose body STACKS the six family sections
; (General / Timing / Resist / Spank / Scenes & FX / Lap Sitting - the
; user's own wording), each preceded by a section-header row:
;   - SUPERSESSION BANNER (not silent deletion): REV-109b's in-page
;     section-NAVIGATION model - the _biSection state, the index render,
;     the "Open" rows, the "<< Back" rows, the nav OIDs + the
;     CurrentPage-guarded handler chain - is REMOVED by this pass per the
;     user's ruling. Register entry 17a ("Open"/"<< Back" drafts) is VOIDED
;     with it: the strings it gated no longer exist.
;   - PAGE HEADER: the REV-76 title + tagline rider (carried from the
;     Settings header pair).
;   - SECTION HEADERS: the REV-80 house pattern - spacer + header row
;     (the "Auto-Apply Sets" exemplar, SlaveTats page).
;   - CENSUS (Task 1.3): every REV-109 option present EXACTLY ONCE in the
;     stacked body, zero lost, zero duplicated (before == after enforced;
;     receipt in the build record).
;   - ASCII sweep (Task 1.5): the new surfaces are the page/section header
;     rows + spacers; the six section names are the user's own list
;     (register 17b, cited not gated).

; has no cached state for THIS quest's formID — everything OnConfigInit builds
; is fresh, so no v-bump is needed for the replacement itself. Future content
; changes to pages/options bump this number (the canonical path from here;
; the SkyUI version-field lesson documented at length in the old script's

; The old quest's v1..v7 lineage (REV-68 Acheron consolidation, REV-72
; SlaveTats section, REV-74 color/release/observation) is history — see

Int Function GetVersion()
    ; REV-79: FIRST canonical bump on the REV-76 clean baseline (v1 -> v2) —
    ; the MCM restructure is user-visible (Acheron + SlaveTats promote to
    ; top-level pages), which is exactly what this machinery exists for.
    ; REV-80: SECOND canonical bump (v2 -> v3) — the Plugins page DISSOLVES:
    ; each integration becomes its own top-level page (user ruling); the
    ; SlaveTats page's set-assignment section is retitled "Auto-Apply Sets"
    ; (configuration-vs-picker clarity, §7-approved copy).
    ; REV-85: THIRD canonical bump (v3 -> v4) — the "GS Poses" top-level page
    ; joins (gender policy home, posing-gender.md §2b; page-count 10 -> 11).
    ; REV-93: FOURTH canonical bump (v4 -> v5) — the Execute-gate option
    ; (REV-92, mis-built in the DEAD v7 script) is ported into THIS live
    ; script's General page (dogfood-failure fix; wrong-script defect).
    ; REV-106: FIFTH canonical bump (v5 -> v6) — S4a severance: the MCM becomes the
    ; framework's config surface; pages go presence-gated (motherboard resolution for
    ; the 8 Baka pages, GS esp probe for GS Poses). Page STRUCTURE is now combo-
    ; dependent, so every pre-severance save crosses this bump once and rebuilds.
    ; REV-107: SIXTH canonical bump (v6 -> v7) — S4b physical re-home: the quest
    ; record moves to DeD_Framework.esp (02000800) and the script/EDID rename to
    ; DeD_MCM. No page/OID change; the bump exists for the fresh-instance canary
    ; (every existing save spins the moved quest's fresh instance and crosses it).
    ; REV-109: SEVENTH canonical bump (v7 -> v8) — the productization MCM
    ; restructure: a new first "Settings" page; the five Baka pages renamed into
    ; the "Baka - " section prefix; page-count 11 -> 12 (Main+GS combo). Page
    ; STRUCTURE changed, so every existing save crosses this bump once and
    ; rebuilds (the four-saga rule; the v2 canary lesson applies - rebuild
    ; before the canary trace).
    ; REV-109b: EIGHTH canonical bump (v8 -> v9) - the Option A restructure
    ; fix: the five "Baka - " prefix pages + the Lap Sitting page fold into
    ; ONE "Baka Interactions" page hosting six in-page sections; page-count
    ; 12 -> 7 (Main+GS combo). Page STRUCTURE changed, so every existing
    ; save crosses this bump once and rebuilds (the four-saga rule; rebuild
    ; before the canary trace, the v2 lesson standing).
    ; REV-109c: NINTH canonical bump (v9 -> v10) - restructure pass 3: the
    ; section NAVIGATION model is removed; the six sections STACK in the one
    ; page body under section headers. Page COUNT is unchanged (7/6), but
    ; the page BODY structure changed, so every existing save crosses this
    ; bump once and rebuilds (the four-saga rule; v2 lesson standing).
    ; REV-134c: TENTH canonical bump (v10 -> v11) - the More Cum toggle joins
    ; the Cum Effects page (register 24, ruled; mis-built into the retired
    ; v7 script at REV-133c, §148 root cause) and every Cum-page option
    ; gains a plain-language description row. New option on an existing
    ; page + visible body change: every existing save crosses this bump
    ; once and rebuilds. No data migration (motherboard property only,
    ; default flipped to OFF by user ruling).
    ; REV-134d: ELEVENTH canonical bump (v11 -> v12) - THE MCM REDESIGN
    ; (user-ruled R2): "Cum Cues" renamed to "Cum Cues Module Toggle"; the
    ; "SexLab Climax Proxy Share" toggle RETIRED (replaced by the
    ; "Decal Source Selection" cycling menu option, presence-gated); the
    ; REV-134c static subtext rows REMOVED in favor of info-text tooltips.
    ; Visible body change on an existing page: every existing save crosses
    ; this bump once and rebuilds (the four-saga rule; v2 lesson standing).
    ; KEY MIGRATION (flagged, default-fresh per the user's OCum-default
    ; ruling): bSLProxyEnabled is NOT migrated to iDecalSource -- the
    ; dropdown starts at 0/OCum on every save.
    ; REV-145: TWELFTH canonical bump (v12 -> v13) - THE BAKA-DAEMON SESSION:
    ; the Ambient Modes section (Mephala Mode / Molag Bal Mode toggles) joins
    ; the Baka Interactions page; "NPCs May Target You" (the REV-144 central
    ; player-target policy, entry-30a DRAFT label) replaces "Player Can Be
    ; Target"; "Ambient Target Policy" (the three-level target-sex dropdown,
    ; ruling (c)) replaces "Target Sex"; the fold-in rows ("Player Can Be
    ; Spanked", "Allow Male Targets", "Victim Sex Allowed") are REMOVED (the
    ; motherboard properties stay declared). Visible body change on existing
    ; pages: every existing save crosses this bump once and rebuilds (the
    ; four-saga rule; v2 lesson standing).
    ; REV-153: FOURTEENTH canonical bump (v14 -> v15) - the Follow-up Prompt
    ; toggle joins the Fill Her Up page (the 134f Follow-up Prompt pattern
    ; applied to FHU; label + tooltip are register entry-33 DRAFTs at the
    ; user's pen). New option on an existing page + visible body change:

; REV-79 MCM RESTRUCTURE (user ruling, §80 Task 4 item 5): each plugin
; INTEGRATION gets its own top-level page — one integration, one page. The
; two integration-scale sections left "Plugins" ("Acheron", "SlaveTats"); the
; three toggle-scale detection sections stay grouped there (Lap Sitting /
; Cum Detection / FHU Inflation — promoting each would be three near-empty
; pages; judgment call recorded in the REV-79 gate report). Every integration
; page greys out with "(mod not installed)" at PAGE level when the underlying
; mod is absent (the existing per-section presence gates, extended).
;
; REV-80 POLISH RIDER (user rulings, §81): the Plugins page is DISSOLVED —
; "one integration, one page" is now total: Lap Sitting / Cum Effects /
; Fill Her Up each promote to their own top-level page (expandable later;
; the REV-79 near-empty-pages judgment is superseded by the user ruling).
; No residual Plugins page remains. Absent states stay page-level grey-outs
; "(mod not installed)". The SlaveTats page's set-assignment section is
; retitled "Auto-Apply Sets" (it configures which set fires automatically
; per event; the in-game picker always offers the full range — §7 copy).
