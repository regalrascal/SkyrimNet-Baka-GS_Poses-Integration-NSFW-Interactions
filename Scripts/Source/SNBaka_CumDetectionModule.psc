Scriptname SNBaka_CumDetectionModule
; REV-96 Task 2: cum-detection module (recordless detection class -- module contract
; point 3, fomod.md section architecture). Extracted BEHAVIOR-PRESERVING from the
; REV-63/65 detection-triggers section of SkyrimNet_BakaIntegration.psc (the §64
; class: every handler signature and sentinel moved verbatim; only the call shape
; changed -- the motherboard's ModEvent handlers forward here, because ModEvents are
; Form-members and a recordless script can never receive a ModEvent dispatch).
; NO foreign types beyond what the moved code already used: SkyrimNet_BakaSL (our own
; SexLab bridge, compile-stubbed in tools\compile\local) and SkyrimNetApi.
;
; REV-117 CUM-V2 STATE LAYER (REV-115 Task 3, unblocked by the §127 re-dogfood):
; DeDService.* state-family writes ride EVERY cum application signal, gated on
; DeD_ServicePresent() (SKSE.GetPluginVersion probe; the wiring is inert without the
; DLL -- no error, no orphan writes, v1 behavior exactly). State family (module
; "cum", keys per service-dll.md §5):
;   cum.present          Bool, actor-keyed     -- TRUE while a cum effect persists
;   cum.last_location    String, actor-keyed   -- location literal (OCum Area domain
;                                                 or SL FX domain mouth/vagina/rectum)
;   cum.last_source      String, actor-keyed   -- "ocum" | "sexlab_pplus" | "sexlab_vanilla" | "sl_proxy"
;   cum.last_applied_rt  Float, actor-keyed    -- Utility.GetCurrentRealTime() at write
; Ambient timer rule (module "cum", rule "ambient"): cadence 60s (REV-122: was 120s --
; the first maintenance/expiry tick must land at 60s; maintenance recast, expiry
; and the ambient cue all ride this ONE clock), predicate class 1 (STATE_BOOL_TRUE)
; on cum.present, failsafe 600s, callback "sdb_cum_ambient_due".
; REV-127: the rule's time base is APPLICATION-ANCHORED -- the scheduler re-anchors
; the rule (age=0, next due=cadence) on the predicate's False->True rising edge, so
; the first ambient cue lands application + 60s (never mid-grid), and missed dues
; are SKIPPED, never drained as catch-up bursts (the 10-18 paired 1s-apart fires).
; The 600s failsafe re-anchors with it (a fresh application always gets its full
; window); if the failsafe DISARMS the rule mid-session, the next _WriteCumState
; re-arms it (AddTimerRule is key-deduped, so this is a no-op while the rule lives).
; Timer events arrive as the standard 4-slot ModEvent shape (EventPump.cpp):
; (eventName, strArg, numArg, sender) -- numArg 1 = expired (failsafe), 0 = due tick.
; VERBATIM-NARRATION GUARDRAIL (REV-117, in every touched cue): event text is written
; for the LLM to narrate VERBATIM -- never summarize, never paraphrase, never fold
; into other narration; the event text IS the narration.
;
;
; REV-122 CUM APPLIANCE AUTHORITY (matrix of record, cum-effects.md REV-122): WE
; apply/maintain the cum visual for the state's duration. Tier routing:
;   OCum present (OStim+OCum or SL+OCum) -> OCum DRIVE: call OCumMaleScript.
;     ApplyCum(target, target, area, 1, 1.0, "", 0) -- the GENERIC entry; the
;     location is a plain String ARGUMENT dispatched to per-area functions
;     (OCumMaleScript.psc L304-345, [035.00002] tree; ThreadID=0 = the
;     out-of-scene path). FINAL 0.b ANSWER: the visual is NOT spell-carried --
;     OCumSpell -> OCumEffect is ONLY a cleanup timer (OnEffectFinish cleans
;     out-of-scene, re-casts in-scene, OCumEffect.psc L7-13); the overlay itself
;     is applied by CumOntoArea -> ReadyOverlay (OCumMaleScript.psc L510-536),
;     so a bare Cast of their spell can NEVER produce a location-correct
;     visual. The drive point is the SCRIPT call, not the spell form. Quest
;     resolution: QUST EDIDs in OCum.esp -- "OCumQuest" carries OCumScript,
;     "OCumMaleQuest" carries OCumMaleScript (esp byte-census 2026-10-17);
;     Quest.GetQuest needs no hardcoded formIDs.
;   SL only (SLACS)  -> SexLab's own combo-spell overlays stand (sslActorLibrary
;     AddCum PPLUS L805 / ClearCum L834; persist-until-dispelled). When OCum is
;     present we REPLACE them (ClearCum first -- replace-not-stack, the
;     double-visual guard; also note SL AddCum re-called on an already-cummed
;     actor ESCALATES the texture tier 1->2, so we never re-AddCum).
;   neither         -> state-only (documented degradation).
;   SL proxy (no location) -> never claims overlay application (proxy rule of
;     record); state-only, no drive call.
; MAINTENANCE: ambient ticks are sender-None FOREVER (Scheduler.cpp L124/L149 --
; EventPump::Emit(rule.callbackEvent, nullptr, ...); rule/ambient ticks are not
; actor-addressed), so the wearer is CACHED at application: DeDService type-4
; "cum.wearer" state row (the native FormID slot) + a StorageUtil form pointer
; (None-keyed; PapyrusUtil cosave-persisted, StorageUtil.psc L80/L115) for the
; sender-None tick to find them. Lifetime N=10min (named constant, all expiry
; sites read it). Expiry (tick clock) and the 600s failsafe BOTH clear the
; visual AND the state (REV-117/120 shipped the failsafe as skip-only). Refresh:
; OCum tier recasts OCumSpell on the wearer each maintenance tick -- their own
; cleanup timer (MCM default 5min, OCumMCMScript L342) is SHORTER than our
; lifetime, and the recast resets its duration so OnEffectFinish never cleans
; before our expiry (their own in-scene re-cast pattern, OCumEffect.psc L12).
; OCum re-entry is INTENDED: our SL-leg drive calls their ApplyCum, which
; re-emits ocum_applied_cum (SendCumAppliedEvents, OCumMaleScript.psc L316) ->
; our handler re-writes state source as "ocum" (the visual IS OCum's now --
; correct tier for maintenance) and the cue double-fire is eaten by the shared
; 15s window.
; D5 STALE-STAMP CLAMP: SNBaka.LastCumCueRT is a GetCurrentRealTime float that
; PERSISTS in the cosave, and GetCurrentRealTime resets each launch -- a stamp
; from a longer-prior session reads as "future", so now - stamp < 15.0 locks
; the shared cum-cue window until the NEW session's clock passes the OLD
; session's stamp (up to hours). Same class as the rev-17 muse-stamp clamp
; (SkyrimNet_AnimationsGS.psc L1021, read-time clamp precedent). REV-122 clamps
; at every OnPlayerLoadGame (motherboard), BEFORE Setup() re-arms anything,
; plus the same-class player-keyed deadline stamps (class sweep, see
; ClampStaleRTStamps). NPC-keyed instances of the class cannot be enumerated
; at load (StorageUtil has no key walk) -- documented degradation, polish note.
;
; State: NONE of its own. All toggles (bEnabled, bCumDetectionEnabled, bSLProxyEnabled,
; iCumCueMode) remain the MOTHERBOARD'S Auto properties (the MCM reads them as
; Main.* -- moving them would be a structural MCM change, explicitly out of scope);
; they are read through the akHost parameter. The shared 15s cum-cue cooldown key
; (SNBaka.LastCumCueRT, None-keyed) is unchanged -- same key, same window, so the
; cooldown still spans the OCum events AND the SL proxy exactly as before.
;
; Logging: every sentinel goes through akHost._Log() -- identical strings, identical
; bDebugLog gating (sentinel parity per §67; the [SNBaka] tag is preserved verbatim
; so existing log greps keep working).

; ---- Presence probe (cached: GetFormFromFile on an ABSENT esp logs a hard Papyrus
; error, not a silent None -- the SNBakaSL.Absent-cache lesson). Absence is cached
; on the None key once. MOVED VERBATIM from the motherboard's _OCumInstalled. ----

; ---- REV-122 D5: stale cosave real-time stamp clamp (load-time) ----
; GetCurrentRealTime() resets each launch, but StorageUtil stamps persist in

; "future" here, and every `now - stamp < window` check locks until the new
