; ── Phase 6a: leveled-safe sex lookup ────────────────────────────────────────
; Ported from the Baka "leveledsexfix" community variant (credited there — see the Baka repo's
; Phase 6a port commit): Actor.GetActorBase() returns the EDITOR base, which for generic leveled
; NPCs (bandits, forsworn, vampires, most guards) is a template shell whose sex field is an
; unused placeholder reading MALE — a visibly female bandit reads as male and every female-
; gated path silently refuses her. All three GS gates (crosshair validation, _PoseVibe exec,
; T3 eligibility scan) route through this now. GetLeveledActorBase() (SKSE) returns the game-
; generated base the leveled list resolved to; uniques and the player fall back to the editor
; base (for them it IS the real record). Returns 0 male, 1 female, -1 unknown/none.

; right before any Debug.SendAnimationEvent, so a pose genuinely never fires mid-scene regardless of
; timing. All soft/optional: every check is either a plain StorageUtil key (0 if the other mod isn't
; installed) or a Faction resolved by FormID (None if that mod isn't installed), so this mod keeps
; working standalone with nothing installed.

; ROOT CAUSE this closes: OnInit/_Setup (which calls _InitDaemonPools above) runs
; ONLY when the quest instance is CREATED — new game or quest reset — and NEVER on
; save load. A save whose instance predates the build that added these arrays loads
; the NEW code but every pool member restores as None: Papyrus links save state to
; script variables BY NAME and silently skips variables absent from the save — zero
; log warnings, which is why this hid through fresh-game testing and only surfaced
; in a long-lived save (fresh-game testing worked, long-save testing failed: the
; classic Papyrus lifecycle trap). One cause explained all three 4c-demo symptoms:
; 0 muse seeds (None pool -> .Length reads 0 silently -> _DaemonScan returns 0 ->
; "scan empty" heartbeats with zero _DaemonScan stacks), T3 silence (the _OdCue
; indexing crash aborted _OverdriveTick BEFORE the silence-floor check could run),
; 0 T1 cues (every _OdCue call crashed). The guard is idempotent and tests ALL pool
; arrays the tick chain touches — a partial test invites a partial heal and a second
; chase. It is RETROACTIVE self-healing: every pre-Phase-4 save heals itself on its
; next touch of any guarded entry point, no quest reset or new game needed; after
; that first heal the instance carries the arrays in its own save state and the
; guard is a no-op thereafter (cost when healthy: six None-checks per tick).
