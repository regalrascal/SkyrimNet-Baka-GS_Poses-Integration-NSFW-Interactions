REM REV-57 WARNING (FILE_STRUCTURE.md): the 2026-09-30 repo migration (path 1b^>1a)
REM left stale CMake caches in this build tree (CMakeCache.txt, cmake_install.cmake,
REM compile_commands.json still point at the OLD BKA workspace path). The NEXT clean
REM build of BOTH DLLs requires, from the repo root, BEFORE configuring:
REM   git clean -xdf dll-source/build/ dll-source-gs/build/
REM (or delete both build\release trees manually). Auto-regenerates thereafter.

call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat" >nul 2>&1

REM Paths are resolved relative to this script's own folder (portable â€” clone anywhere).
